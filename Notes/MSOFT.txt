How it works: 

Phases:
Preparative phase:

Companies have to be registered & 
should have e-signature according by the law.

Then, They ask for grants by filling an application
on the web e-government & sign it by e-signature
Also they make a business plan for using EU funds

Officers for granting rewiev it and move to the next step

Analysis Phase:

The next step is detail analysis on business plan. They
decide to grant it or not if it is not very good idea or 
company does not have clear vision.

Final phase: 

If it is granted, move to the funds redirection or 
give them final decision about why they have rejected it

The whole process lasts about 3-18 month nowadays without
e-gov support, this process could last 3-9 months by using 
e-gov, so time is money, isnt it?
